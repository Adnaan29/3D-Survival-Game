# 🎮 Survive The Unseen

Survive The Unseen is a 3D single-player survival game developed using the Unity Engine.  
The game challenges the player to traverse a hostile forest environment, survive staged enemy encounters, and reach a final destination to complete the experience.

This project focuses on implementing core gameplay systems such as player movement, combat mechanics, enemy AI, staged progression, UI systems, and cinematic presentation.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The player begins in a forest terrain and must navigate toward a distant mountain peak.  
Progression is divided into multiple stages, each triggering enemy encounters with increasing difficulty.

Survival depends on movement, combat, and situational awareness. Completing all stages triggers a final cutscene that concludes the game.
